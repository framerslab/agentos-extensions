  - @framers/agentos-ext-public-sources@0.2.0

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- [#242](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/242) [`3787e0e`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/3787e0e1fb4d86bc2180990e44b38a80c8af655a) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Remove a deleted owner's authorization exchanges recorded unconfirmed, and those whose returned grant's revocation expired or could not be opened, in `SourceRevocations.compact()` a day after their end, with their queue rows a day after the rows' own deadline, instead of keeping them for an acknowledgement a deleted owner can never give.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#231](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/231) [`4555f30`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/4555f30cac895f1941abb66dc51e5b35a2abec7e) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Fence source purge and credential transfer, serialize grant refresh across workers, and recover bounded revoke-only attempts independently of account lifetime. Record authorization exchanges before their requests are sent, so a returned grant that is not installed is revoked through the same queue, and an outcome that cannot be confirmed keeps new grants blocked until the account owner acknowledges removing the permission.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [#229](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/229) [`ac76ddf`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/ac76ddf384656e75b89fb6a076389827faf2215c) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Keep counting a recovery whose anchor read keeps failing: after expired history, the anchor read continues the attempt count of the history page that found the expiry, so the count reaches five attempts and the `pollMs` wait instead of the anchor read retrying every second or two. `exclude` and `resetExclusions` keep the committed cursor and make a reconcile the next cycle, which replays history from that cursor after a fresh bounded scan. A reconcile asks for the committed cursor's history before its scan and, when that history has expired, replays from its anchor with one scan and one read pass.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#227](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/227) [`eceb1cf`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/eceb1cffb1b80a6f586e7572a7a103fee06330b3) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Coordinate resumable source synchronization with durable page and document retry episodes, bounded work, renewable leases and independent retention maintenance.

- [#225](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/225) [`e773230`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/e773230b496a6567672286ac42d89e2578b266bb) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Answer a request that cannot start within a second of its reservation as `{ kind: 'late', retryAt }`, retryable with a new attempt id, instead of `duplicate`, which stays the answer for a reused attempt id. `SourceQuota.compact()` now answers how many attempt records, mailbox waits, meter reservations and minute-budget rows it deleted, and whether a table has more to delete.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#223](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/223) [`6e19f78`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/6e19f78f1f731b6f7a6c48d9bd260e7105ca83e5) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Coordinate weighted project, account and daily request budgets with shared SQL spend meters, bounded concurrent dispatch and persistent provider retry times.

### Patch Changes

- [#221](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/221) [`0895297`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/0895297f7ab7e91fd013621c5ceca95df520a793) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Document that `release(handle)` answers false, not null, once the handle's owner fence, lease, generation or `active` check has moved on.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#218](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/218) [`e3d9f07`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/e3d9f07307538a5ec6aa39a05d5f8f20cecf36a3) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Add adapter-backed durable source synchronization with fenced document application, resumable work, complete cursor commits and recoverable lifecycle controls.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#214](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/214) [`28cbd5a`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/28cbd5aceedb0ef2ef36ffdad2349666befb3e4b) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Add optional paged synchronization, durable connection and work contracts, opaque checkpoint transitions and complete-application cursor checks while preserving selected-id connector APIs.

### Patch Changes

- [#210](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/210) [`8edd460`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/8edd460f36b6aeddf60bedaa6b72c4dd2c131055) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Accept a comma inside a quoted `Cache-Control` directive value instead of refusing the header as `invalid_cache_header`; a quoted value left open is still refused.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#205](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/205) [`03d31a2`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/03d31a251d0d0ca3c90489a12a6901c1c38b07fc) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Add an explicit source-cache permission and expiry policy that refuses restricted, ambiguous or expired response metadata before persistence.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#134](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/134) [`f25aa06`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/f25aa068309d61207d78403daebc7ecae3ead4be) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Add a library for a person's own accounts as sources: the account connector interface, passage attribution, line ranges and links, capped response reads, and the shared public-sources limiter with Retry-After handling.
