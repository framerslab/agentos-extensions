# @framers/agentos-ext-weather

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#77](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/77) [`91fd410`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/91fd4108cca945cdb37cb541b1d88e68454f76a1) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Declare `@framers/agentos` as a peer with a floor and no upper bound (`>=0.10.40`), so npm installs the pack next to agentos 0.11 and later releases. The published range (`^0.10.x` or older) excluded them.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#48](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/48) [`fca96a4`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/fca96a478eed589035e6a76fa8995c7223e026d8) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Ship the compiled output. The previous version was published without its `dist` directory, so the package could not be loaded.
