# @framers/agentos-ext-tool-multi-channel-post

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [#155](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/155) [`aab1d8a`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/aab1d8a3b89971ee50bdcabab0aa256754bad5b5) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - The `platforms` description names every platform the tool posts to, farcaster and lemmy included, and the `communityId` a lemmy post needs. It is built from the tool's platform map, so the two cannot differ again.

- [#153](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/153) [`ca5be51`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/ca5be5157e296d730363027d40605f428fd04935) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Adds a README: installation, configuration, the tools the pack registers and what they do.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#119](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/119) [`cf94e65`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/cf94e65b609616589f979a60be6c54d7d27916f6) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - License metadata is Apache-2.0, matching the repository's LICENSE. Versions published before this one carry the license they were published with.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#78](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/pull/78) [`d9561f1`](https://github.com/framerslab/agentos-extensions/commit/d9561f17043bb4953732d9599fe0a2a7c387394d) Thanks [@jddunn](https://github.com/jddunn)! - Declare `@framers/agentos` as a peer with a floor and no upper bound (`>=0.10.40`), so npm installs the pack next to agentos 0.11 and later releases. The published range (`^0.10.x` or older) excluded them.
